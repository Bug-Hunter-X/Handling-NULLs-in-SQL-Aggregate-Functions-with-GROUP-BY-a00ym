This repository demonstrates a common SQL error involving aggregate functions and NULL values within GROUP BY clauses. The `bug.sql` file showcases the erroneous query, while `bugSolution.sql` provides the corrected version. The problem lies in the implicit handling of NULL values by aggregate functions like SUM().  If NULLs are present, they are simply omitted.  The solution offers several ways to address this, including using COALESCE or ISNULL to replace NULLs with 0 before aggregation.
